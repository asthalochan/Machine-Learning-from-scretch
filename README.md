## Introduction

This repository serves as a hub for learning and exploring fundamental machine learning algorithms by building them from scratch. Each sub-repository corresponds to a specific algorithm and provides a detailed implementation in Python.

## Sub-Repositories

Here are the sub-repositories available in this collection:

1. K-Nearest Neighbors 
2. Linear Regression
3. Logistic Regression
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest
6. Naive Bayes
7. Principal Component Analysis 
8. Perceptron
9. Support Vector Machines
10. K-Means

Each sub-repository contains the algorithm's code, detailed explanations, and usage examples to help you understand and apply these machine learning techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started with any specific algorithm, navigate to its corresponding sub-repository and follow the instructions provided in the README file. You'll find code examples, explanations, and guidance on how to use and extend these implementations.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. If you'd like to contribute improvements, bug fixes, or new machine learning algorithm implementations, please follow our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
