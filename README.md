## Introduction

This repository serves as a hub for learning and exploring fundamental machine learning algorithms by building them from scratch. Each sub-repository corresponds to a specific algorithm and provides a detailed implementation in Python.

## Sub-Repositories

Here are the sub-repositories available in this collection:

1. [K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](01 KNN)
2. [Linear Regression](02 Linear Regression)
3. [Logistic Regression](03 Logistic Regression)
4. [Decision Tree](04 Decision Trees)
5. [Random Forest](05 Random Forests)
6. [Naive Bayes](06 NaiveBayes)
7. [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](07 PCA)
8. [Perceptron](08 Perceptron)
9. [Support Vector Machines (SVM)](09 SVM)
10. [K-Means](10 KMeans)

Each sub-repository contains the algorithm's code, detailed explanations, and usage examples to help you understand and apply these machine learning techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started with any specific algorithm, navigate to its corresponding sub-repository and follow the instructions provided in the README file. You'll find code examples, explanations, and guidance on how to use and extend these implementations.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. If you'd like to contribute improvements, bug fixes, or new machine learning algorithm implementations, please follow our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
